# Data Leakage Fix - Comprehensive Report


I have successfully identified and addressed the critical data leakage issue in the real data pipeline. The root cause was **future return columns being included as features** during training, causing perfect overfitting.


| Metric | Before (Original) | After (Corrected) | Status |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Train AUC | 1.0000 | 0.9671 | ✅ Improved |
| Validation AUC | 0.5023 | 0.4898 | ❌ Below Threshold |
| AUC Gap | 0.4977 | 0.4773 | ⚠️ Still Large |


**Primary Issue**: Future return columns (`target_1d`, `target_3d`, `target_5d`, `target_10d`) were included as features in the processed data files, creating perfect data leakage.

**Secondary Issues**: 
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) had values from index 0, suggesting look-ahead bias
- Precomputed targets had low correlation (0.0353) with actual price movements


1. **Removed Future Return Columns**: Eliminated all `target_*` columns from feature set
2. **Created Proper Target**: Used `close.shift(-1) > close` for next-day direction prediction
3. **Applied Temporal Splits**: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test with strict temporal boundaries
4. **Standardized Features**: Applied StandardScaler fitted only on training data


✅ **Real Market Data Confirmed**: Proper price relationships, realistic volume ranges
✅ **Temporal Alignment**: Consistent date ordering across splits
✅ **Feature Integrity**: 17 clean features without future information


❌ **NOT READY FOR INTEGRATION**

Additional work needed to meet validation AUC ≥ 0.55 threshold.


- **Directory**: `data/corrected_sagemaker_input`
- **Files**: train.csv, validation.csv, test.csv, feature_metadata.json, scaler.joblib
- **Features**: 17 clean features
- **Samples**: Train + Validation + Test splits


1. Investigate additional feature engineering to improve validation AUC
2. Consider alternative target horizons (3-day, 5-day returns)
3. Implement additional technical indicators with proper lookback
4. Re-test with enhanced feature set
