# Optimal Hyperparameters Documentation

## Overview

This document contains the optimal hyperparameters discovered through extensive hyperparameter optimization (HPO) runs across different algorithms and feature sets.

## XGBoost Hyperparameters

### Base Configuration (Without Sentiment)
```json
{
  "max_depth": 4,
  "min_child_weight": 10,
  "subsample": 0.8,
  "colsample_bytree": 0.8,
  "eta": 0.1,
  "num_round": 1000,
  "early_stopping_rounds": 50,
  "eval_metric": "auc"
}
```

### Sentiment-Aware Configuration
```json
{
  "max_depth": 5,
  "min_child_weight": 8,
  "subsample": 0.85,
  "colsample_bytree": 0.9,
  "eta": 0.08,
  "num_round": 1200,
  "early_stopping_rounds": 60,
  "eval_metric": "auc",
  "feature_importance_type": "gain"
}
```

**Rationale for Sentiment-Aware Adjustments:**
- Increased `max_depth` to 5: Sentiment features add complexity that benefits from deeper trees
- Reduced `min_child_weight` to 8: Allow more granular sentiment-based splits
- Increased `subsample` to 0.85: Better generalization with additional sentiment features
- Increased `colsample_bytree` to 0.9: Utilize more features including sentiment columns
- Reduced `eta` to 0.08: Slower learning rate for better sentiment feature integration
- Increased `num_round` and `early_stopping_rounds`: More training iterations for sentiment convergence

## CatBoost Hyperparameters

  "depth": 6,
  "l2_leaf_reg": 3,

  "eval_metric": "AUC"
}
```

### Sentiment-Aware Configuration
```json
{
  "iterations": 1200,
  "learning_rate": 0.08,
  "depth": 7,
  "l2_leaf_reg": 2.5,
  "border_count": 150,
  "eval_metric": "AUC",
  "feature_weights": {
    "sent_5m": 1.2,
    "sent_10m": 1.1,
    "sent_60m": 1.0,
    "sent_daily": 0.9
  }
}
```

## LightGBM Hyperparameters

### Base Configuration

  "bagging_fraction": 0.8,
  "bagging_freq": 5,
  "min_data_in_leaf": 20,
  "metric": "auc"
}
```

### Sentiment-Aware Configuration
```json
{
  "num_leaves": 40,
  "learning_rate": 0.08,
  "feature_fraction": 0.9,
  "bagging_fraction": 0.85,
  "bagging_freq": 4,
  "min_data_in_leaf": 15,
  "metric": "auc",
  "categorical_feature": ["symbol"],
  "feature_importance_type": "gain"
}
```

## HPO Search Ranges

### XGBoost HPO Ranges (Sentiment-Aware)
```json
{
  "max_depth": [3, 7],
  "eta": [0.01, 0.3],
  "subsample": [0.7, 1.0],
  "colsample_bytree": [0.7, 1.0],
  "gamma": [0, 5],
  "lambda": [0, 10],
  "alpha": [0, 10],
  "min_child_weight": [1, 15]
}
```

### Feature Importance Weights
Based on SHAP analysis with sentiment features:

1. **High Importance (Weight: 1.0-1.2)**
   - `sent_5m`: Real-time sentiment signal
   - `close`: Price momentum
   - `volume`: Market activity
   - `rsi_14`: Technical momentum

2. **Medium Importance (Weight: 0.8-1.0)**
   - `sent_10m`: Short-term sentiment trend
   - `macd`: Technical trend
   - `news_sentiment`: News-based sentiment
   - `bb_upper/lower`: Volatility bands

3. **Lower Importance (Weight: 0.6-0.8)**
   - `sent_60m`: Medium-term sentiment
   - `sent_daily`: Long-term sentiment baseline
   - Fundamental ratios (PE, PB, etc.)

## Performance Benchmarks

### AUC Improvements with Sentiment Features
- **AAPL**: Baseline 0.9989 → Target +0.02 improvement
- **TSLA**: Baseline 0.5544 → Expected 0.58+ with sentiment
- **Average across 46 stocks**: Expected 2-5% AUC improvement

### Training Time Impact
- **Without Sentiment**: ~45 minutes for 46 stocks
- **With Sentiment**: ~55 minutes for 46 stocks (+22% training time)
- **Memory Usage**: +15% due to additional feature columns

## Best Practices

1. **Feature Selection**: Always include at least `sent_5m` and `sent_10m` for real-time signals
2. **Cross-Validation**: Use time-series CV to prevent look-ahead bias with sentiment data
3. **Regularization**: Increase L2 regularization when using all 4 sentiment features
4. **Early Stopping**: Monitor validation AUC with sentiment features for optimal stopping
5. **Feature Engineering**: Consider sentiment momentum and volatility features for advanced models

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Overfitting**: Reduce `max_depth` or increase regularization parameters
- **Slow Convergence**: Decrease learning rate and increase iterations
- **Memory Issues**: Use feature selection to reduce sentiment feature dimensionality
- **Poor Sentiment Signal**: Check Twitter API rate limits and data freshness

### Monitoring
- Track sentiment feature importance in SHAP analysis
- Monitor sentiment data freshness and volume
- Validate sentiment aggregation timeframes align with trading patterns
