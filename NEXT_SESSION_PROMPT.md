# 9-Step Leak-Proof Retraining Process

This document outlines the comprehensive 9-step process for leak-proof model retraining that ensures temporal integrity and prevents data leakage.

## Step 1: Time-Series CV Splits
- Implement walk-forward cross-validation with chronological order
- Use 6-month rolling windows for training/validation splits
- Ensure no future data leaks into past predictions
- Validate temporal alignment of features and targets

## Step 2: Feature Selection & Regularization
- Apply L1/L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
- Use recursive feature elimination with cross-validation
- Implement feature importance thresholding
- Remove features with unstable importance across CV folds

## Step 3: SHAP Stability Check
- Calculate SHAP values across all CV folds
- Identify features with inconsistent SHAP importance
- Remove features with |mean SHAP| < 0.01
- Validate feature stability across time periods

## Step 4: Early Stopping Implementation
- Monitor validation AUC across CV folds
- Stop training when validation performance plateaus
- Use patience parameter to prevent premature stopping
- Log early stopping decisions for reproducibility

## Step 5: AUC ≥ 0.60 Threshold Gate
- Enforce minimum AUC threshold of 0.60 for all models
- Reject models that fail to meet performance criteria
- Log threshold violations and model rejections
- Implement automatic retry with different hyperparameters

## Step 6: Temporal Validation
- Validate model performance on out-of-time test sets
- Check for performance degradation over time
- Ensure consistent performance across market regimes
- Validate prediction stability across time periods

## Step 7: Leak Detection Tests
- Run comprehensive data leakage detection
- Check for future information in feature construction
- Validate target variable alignment with prediction timeline
- Test for inadvertent look-ahead bias

## Step 8: Model Ensemble Validation
- Validate individual model contributions to ensemble
- Check for model correlation and diversity
- Ensure ensemble improves upon individual models
- Validate ensemble stability across time periods

## Step 9: Production Readiness Check
- Final validation on holdout test set
- Performance metrics documentation
- Model artifact validation and storage
- Deployment readiness confirmation

## Implementation Notes

### Time-Series CV Configuration
```python
def create_time_series_cv_folds(data, n_splits=5, test_size=0.2):
    """Create time-series cross-validation folds"""
    # Implementation respects chronological order
    # No shuffling or random sampling
    # Each fold uses only past data for training
```

### Feature Stability Validation
```python
def validate_feature_stability(features, shap_values, threshold=0.01):
    """Validate feature importance stability across CV folds"""
    # Check SHAP value consistency
    # Remove unstable features
    # Log stability metrics
```

### AUC Threshold Enforcement
```python
def enforce_auc_threshold(model_performance, threshold=0.60):
    """Enforce minimum AUC threshold for model acceptance"""
    # Reject models below threshold
    # Log performance metrics
    # Trigger retry if needed
```

## Success Criteria

1. **Temporal Integrity**: All CV splits respect chronological order
2. **Feature Stability**: All features pass SHAP stability tests
3. **Performance Threshold**: All models achieve AUC ≥ 0.60
4. **Leak Detection**: No data leakage detected in any component
5. **Ensemble Quality**: Ensemble outperforms individual models
6. **Production Ready**: All artifacts validated and deployment-ready

## Failure Handling

- **AUC < 0.60**: Automatic retry with different hyperparameters
- **Feature Instability**: Remove unstable features and retrain
- **Data Leakage**: Stop process and investigate data pipeline
- **Temporal Violations**: Fix CV splits and restart training
- **Ensemble Failure**: Investigate individual model issues

This process ensures robust, leak-free models suitable for production deployment.
